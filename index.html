			<p> Dear Dr. Michaels, </p>
			<span>I just wanted to let you know that I will not be in New York next week, but I'll be online all week and can meet over Skype!</span><span> Next week to continue iterating over our designs. </span><span>It would be great if we can get your input on the lo-fi prototypes as soon as possible so Priscilla and I can focus and continue to iterate on our designs. </span>

			<p> Dear Dr. Shiri, </p>
			<span>My team and I are currently working on a project that is developing TTS using a hardware design. </span><span> We are co conducting the the goal to identify how to improve our TTS design to  ore intuitive as well as also allow our its users to be more efficient when using TTS. </span><span> We are reaching out to in hopes that you can help us find individuals that use TTS and would be interested in formally testing our design and providing feedback during a 40 min study at Cornell Tech.</span>

			<p>Dear Professor Radley, </p>
			<span>After reviewing the notes from class on Monday.</span><span>There was something that seemed odd to me. </span><span>In Charlotte Perkins Gilman. </span><span> The ending can be interpreted in different ways correct.</span><span> In my notes I wrote that the ending can be seen as both a triumph for the protagonist as well as a tragic end. </span><span>A float representing the rate value.</span>

			<span>A float representing the rate value.</span><span> It can range between 0.1 (lowest) and 10 (highest), with 1 being the default pitch for the current platform or voice, which should correspond to a normal speaking rate.</span>
